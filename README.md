#  Verilog-Based Washing Machine Controller  

##  Overview  

This project implements a **Washing Machine Controller** using **Verilog HDL**.  
The system simulates the entire washing process â€” including **water fill**, **wash**, **rinse**, and **spin** cycles.  
It is designed for **FPGA implementation** and demonstrates **sequential control** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.

##  Features  

###  Water Fill Cycle  
- Fills the tank to a predefined level.  

###  Wash Cycle  
- Simulates washing action for a set duration.  

###  Rinse Cycle  
- Drains and refills water for rinsing clothes.  

###  Spin Cycle  
- Activates the motor to dry clothes.  

###  User Inputs  
- **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset** controls to manage operation.  

###  Display Outputs  
- **LEDs** or **7-segment display** indicate the current cycle.
